## 42 Cursus?

42cursus comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as "inner circle" and the second one, "outer treks" - due to the Holy Graph layout (see image below).

The inner circle is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimum level required for activities such as internships and interchange.

The outer treks is a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development which allows cadets to specialize on whatever subject they prefer.
