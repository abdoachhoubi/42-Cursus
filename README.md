## 42 Cursus?

42cursus offers two categories of projects, referred to as the "inner circle" and "outer treks" based on the Holy Graph layout (depicted in the image below).

The inner circle encompasses the fundamental curriculum, requiring completion of all projects to achieve level 7 - the minimum level prerequisite for internships and interchange.

On the other hand, the outer treks provide a variety of project trails encompassing subjects such as operational systems and web development, which allow cadets to specialize in their preferred subject.
